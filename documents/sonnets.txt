Do not stand at my grave and weep:
I am not there; I do not sleep
I am a thousand winds that blow
I am the diamond glints on snow
I am the sun on ripened grain
I am the gentle autumn rain
When you awaken in the morning’s hush
I am the swift uplifting rush
Of quiet birds in circling flight
I am the soft starshine at night
Do not stand at my grave and cry:
I am not there; I did not die

I have been one acquainted with the night
I have walked out in rain—and back in rain
I have outwalked the furthest city light

I have looked down the saddest city lane
I have passed by the watchman on his beat
And dropped my eyes unwilling to explain

I have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
When far away an interrupted cry
Came over houses from another street

But not to call me back or say good-by;
And further still at an unearthly height
One luminary clock against the sky

Proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right
I have been one acquainted with the night

I met a traveller from an antique land
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
Stand in the desert Near them on the sand
Half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive stamped on these lifeless things
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed;
And on the pedestal these words appear:
"My name is Ozymandias king of kings:
Look on my works ye Mighty and despair!"
Nothing beside remains Round the decay
Of that colossal wreck boundless and bare
The lone and level sands stretch far away

Love is not all: It is not meat nor drink
Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain
Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink
and rise and sink and rise and sink again
Love cannot fill the thickened lung with breath
Nor clean the blood nor set the fractured bone;
Yet many a man is making friends with death
even as I speak for lack of love alone
It well may be that in a difficult hour
pinned down by need and moaning for release
or nagged by want past resolution's power
I might be driven to sell your love for peace
Or trade the memory of this night for food
It may well be I do not think I would
